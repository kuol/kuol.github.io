	<!-- <p class="intro">Data Science leader with .</p> -->
	<p>Hi, I'm Kuo. I obtained my PhD in Applied Mathematics in 2012 and I have been in the field of Data Science ever since. I have led Software Engineering and Data Science teams in a public company, pre-IPO companies and Series B, Series C tech startups. My industry experience spans from Enterprise Analytics Software, E-Commerce Payment to HR Software. Currently, I'm the Director of Artificial Intelligence at <a href="https://karat.com/">Karat</a>.</p>
	<p>I'm also a working mom. I have two young children. I had to take a career break in 2020. I have many hilarious parenting stories that will make you laugh.</p>
	<p>And, I'm an immigrant. Navigating a different culture and finding my own voice as a leader didn't come easy. I have developed a lot of understanding and gratitude while advancing my career. </p>
	<p>Finally, I'm a life-long learner. I am open to all possibilities in life. I believe that we must look inward to find strenghs and happiness.</p>
